    <h3>Ingredients for 4 servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 ml (2 cups) heavy cream</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>100 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar, plus extra for caramelizing</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean (or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the custard:</p>
            <p>In a saucepan, heat the cream with the vanilla bean (split and seeds scraped) 
                or vanilla extract until it just begins to simmer. Remove from heat and let 
                it sit for a few minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until pale and slightly thickened. 
                Slowly pour the warm cream into the egg mixture while whisking continuously.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a jug. Pour it into four ramekins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place the ramekins in a deep baking dish. Fill the dish with hot water halfway 
                up the sides of the ramekins (water bath).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the custard is just set but still slightly wobbly 
            in the center.</li>
        <li>Remove from the water bath and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at 
            least 2 hours (or overnight).</li>
        <li>Before serving, sprinkle a thin, even layer of sugar over each custard. Use a 
            kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar until golden and crisp. Let it sit for a 
            minute to harden before serving.</li>
    </ol>
